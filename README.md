This game will have the user choose a set of two cards out of a grid. If they match, the user scores a point. If they don't, the user has to try again.
Scores will be calculated using the amount of time the player took to uncover all of the cards, and they will be posted on a leaderboard. It will utilize image APIs and a custom image collection to make sure that no two games are ever the same!

### Key Features
- Logging in to record your progress
- Gameplay using randomized images
- Ability to see other player's progress in real time
- A scoreboard that users can sort by total score, average score,
